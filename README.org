/being a small tool for managing a wiki on a social unix server/

This is a new project. It's a formalization of the strange 777 /home/wiki user
that has existed on [[https://tilde.town][tilde.town]] since time immemorial.

You can think of this project as a very special-cased static site generator with
as few features as possible.

For now, check out the [[https://github.com/tildetown/tilde-wiki/blob/master/rfc.org][rfc]].
